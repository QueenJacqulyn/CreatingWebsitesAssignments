        <p>"A house divided against itself cannot stand."</p>
        <img src="lincoln.jpg">
        <p>I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to
            be
            dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become
            all
            one thing or all the other. </p>
        <p>Either the opponents of slavery, will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind
            shall
            rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward,
            till
            it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new — North as well as South.</p>

        <p>Have we no tendency to the latter condition?</p>

        <p>Let any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination — piece of machinery
            so
            to speak — compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision. Let him consider not only what
            work
            the machinery is adapted to do, and how well adapted; but also, let him study the history of its
            construction,
            and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he can, to trace the evidence of design and concert of action,
            among
            its chief architects, from the beginning.</p>
